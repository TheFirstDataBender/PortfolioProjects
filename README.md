Project 2
Data Preprocessing
This repository contains an example of how to use the 'StandardScaler' class from the 'scikit-learn' library to normalize a data frame in Python.

Installation
To use this code, you will need to have 'scikit-learn' and 'pandas' installed. 

Usage
The code creates a simple dataset for values'Age' and 'Income' as keys. This data is then transformed into a Dataframe using pandas, and then normalized using the  StandardScaler class.
The result of the transformation is a numpy array, which is then converted back into a Dataframe and printed

This code is intended to be a simple example of how to use the StandardScaler class and is not intended to be used in production.

Please feel free to make any improvements or suggest any changes.
